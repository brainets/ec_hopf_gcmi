# Effective Connectivity estiate based on Hopf model

Hopf model inversion based on SEEG empirical data during task conditions

1.- Estimates the effective connectivity computed using Gaussian-Copula Mutual Information 

Main script: /scripts/eff_hopf_gcmi.m

2.- Estimates the effective connectivity computed using Gaussian-Copula Mutual Information by adjusting the Feature-specific Information Transfer (FIT) to the model

Main script: /scripts/eff_hopf_gcmi_FIT.m
